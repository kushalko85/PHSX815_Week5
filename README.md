`numerical.py` performs integration for the function 4x^3exp(-x) using trapezoidal method and gauss quadrature method. The procedure to run this code can be found by typing,

`numerical.py -h` in the terminal.


Analytical integration of our function in the limits from 0 to 5 gives 17.6393780328633. 
If we use 20 steps for our numerical integration trapezoid rule will give us the solution to be 17.63248528195609 and Gauss quadrature method gives us 17.639377155148335 . Hence, we can see that for a given number of steps, calculation by using Gauss Quadrature method is effiecient and has less error compared to trapezoidal method.
